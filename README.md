# AddCode-LazyLoader
 
Firstly I started this challenge and decided to do the Touple List approach, then I noticed regarding the requirments for this challenge, it is not specified if we call 2 times the Evaluate method, the collection of funcs is reset or no. 
Taking into account the Touple approach didn't reset the collection, a Queue approach came into my mind and I decided to do another and diferent implementation for this challenge.
Yes, I could assume one condition or another, but by curiosity I wondered if I have two different approaches, which one would have a better performance, so I googled for the Benchmark Framework tutorial and I implemented it on this challenge so I could see if there are any expressive variations on its performances (apparently not :-) )
